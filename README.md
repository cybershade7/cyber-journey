- Day 1- I've leaned some basic command in linux. Can't say I'm intrigue. It's getting more excited. I'm using "overthewire" and "chatgpt" to learn linux command as fast as I can. Maybe in future,
  I'm gonna use some more advanced tools, who knows. ( cd, mv, rm, grep, find, sort, uniq, cat, touch, echo, ls, file and so on )
